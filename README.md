# Fraud Detection
Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview

This project focuses on building an intelligent fraud detection system using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent financial transactions. The objective is to improve proactive fraud detection while minimizing false positives and ensuring model interpretability.

Problem Statement

Financial fraud causes significant monetary losses and operational risk. Traditional rule-based systems are limited in adapting to evolving fraud patterns. This project applies data-driven machine learning models to detect fraudulent behavior efficiently and accurately.
